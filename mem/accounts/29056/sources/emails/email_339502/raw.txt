Hi Anthony,

Preliminary pricing from carriers is available. We're preparing a formal quote package and will send a full summary shortly. Based on initial indications, expected annual cost is in the low thousands (rounded estimate) depending on selected limits and payroll details.

We'll follow up with options and any carrier subjectivities. If you'd like to discuss coverage limits or payment plans before we send, reply and we can set a quick call.

Best,
Jordan Kim
