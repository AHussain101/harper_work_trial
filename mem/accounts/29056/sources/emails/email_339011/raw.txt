Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Anthony,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We just submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial quotes soon.

To help us move faster, please upload the requested documents (loss runs, COIs, any prior policies) using our secure upload portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload

Loss runs are a report from your prior insurer showing claim history; these help underwriters assess risk and speed up quoting. If you need help obtaining loss runs, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Certificates of Insurance (COI)
- Loss run statements for the prior 3 years (or for the period you've been insured)
- Any special contract insurance requirements you need to meet

Best,
Jordan Kim
