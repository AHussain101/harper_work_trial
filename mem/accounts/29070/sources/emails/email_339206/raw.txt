Insurance Application Follow-up
Hi Marcus,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect to hear initial quote options shortly.

To help speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, COIs, vehicle records) to our secure portal:
https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/SMF-4821

If available, please provide:
- Loss runs for prior coverage (last 3 years or less if not available)
- Any certificate of insurance requirements for contracts or customers
- Any additional coverage needs (cargo limits, hired/non-owned, etc.)

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
