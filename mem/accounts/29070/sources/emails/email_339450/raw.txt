Hello Marcus,

We received an initial carrier response and have a couple of follow-ups before finalizing quotes:
- Please confirm the vehicle ownership (personal vs business)
- Upload proof of prior insurance / loss runs if available
- Confirm whether any additional drivers need to be added

Once we have those items, we can finalize the best carrier option for long-haul coverage and cargo limits.

Thanks,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
