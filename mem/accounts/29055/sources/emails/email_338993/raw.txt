Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Marcus,

Thanks again for speaking with us — we submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial quotes soon.

To speed things up, please upload any prior policy documents or loss run reports (if available) at the secure upload portal below.

Upload documents securely: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/SS-001

Loss runs are a report from your prior insurer that show claim history (or certify none). If you need help obtaining these, reply and we can assist.

If available, please also provide:
- Any certificate of insurance (COI) requirements you must meet
- Details on any specific coverage gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
