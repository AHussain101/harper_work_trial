Hi Marcus,

Thanks for sending the documents. Underwriting reviewed and listed a few minor subjectivities (standard items). Once you confirm acceptance of the quote we will send applicant-facing documents and payment options. If you want to bind immediately, reply with the preferred effective date and we'll initiate the binder process.

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
Harper Insurance
