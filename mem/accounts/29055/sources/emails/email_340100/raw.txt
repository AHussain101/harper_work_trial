Hello Marcus,

One quick follow-up from underwriting — if you can, please upload any prior policy declarations or loss run reports for the last 3 years to help speed binding.

Secure upload: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/SS-001

If you do not have loss runs, a copy of your most recent policy declarations will suffice.

Thanks,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
