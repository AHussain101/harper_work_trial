HARPER AGENT: Hello, this is Alex with Harper Insurance.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi, this is Francine at the Commercial Insurance Center. I have Marco Rivera on the other line.
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marco, thanks for joining. How are you today?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I'm doing good.
HARPER AGENT: Great. I see this is a business that's been open for three years — correct?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, started in 2022.
HARPER AGENT: And you do both shop and mobile tinting?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, about 75% shop, 25% mobile.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect. For underwriting, because you occasionally handle customer vehicles, we have a driver's license on file for you (redacted).
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Okay, that's fine.
HARPER AGENT: And coverage requested is $1,000,000 general liability?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, that's right.
HARPER AGENT: Great — I have everything I need and will submit to carriers. Expect quotes in 24-48 business hours.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Thank you.
