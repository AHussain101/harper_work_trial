Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Marco,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial responses shortly.

To help us speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, COIs, or other underwriting items) using our secure upload portal: https://files.example-insure.com/upload/elm-123

If you need assistance obtaining loss runs, or have coverage requirements for a contract or lease, let us know and we will help.

Best,
Alex Moreno
