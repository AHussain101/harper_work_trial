Hi Avery,

Thanks — I called back with the EIN. For privacy I'll note the EIN ends in 4321. We confirm we have 3 W-2 employees and annual payroll is approximately $44.8k. We don't have prior loss runs (new business) but will provide any additional documents if requested.

Please proceed with quoting and let me know if you need anything else.

Best,
