Hi Marisol,

Following our call, we still need the company's federal EIN (or a note that it will be provided later) to submit for workers' compensation quotations. Please also confirm the total annual payroll and that you have 3 W-2 employees on staff.

If you have a current policy or loss history, a short loss run or letter from your prior carrier will help speed placement.

Thanks,
Avery (Harper Intake)
