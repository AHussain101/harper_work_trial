Insurance application follow-up

Hi Marisol,

Thanks for speaking with us today. We've submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial responses shortly.

To help speed the quoting process, please upload any available documents (loss runs if you have prior coverage, payroll details, and any contract COI requirements) via our secure upload portal below.

Secure upload: https://portal.example-insure.com/uploads/submit-claim-abc123

Requested documents:
- Loss runs (last 3 years if available)
- Proof of payroll / W-2 headcount
- Any required COI language for clients or contracts

If you need help obtaining loss runs or uploading documents, reply to this email or call our intake team.

Best,
Avery Kim
