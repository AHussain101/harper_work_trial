Hi Brandon,

Thanks for the estimate. A couple questions before we proceed:
1) What is the recommended property limit for our contents (we estimate business personal property around $100k)?
2) Are there options to increase coverage for building improvements while keeping premium reasonable?

Appreciate your guidance.
