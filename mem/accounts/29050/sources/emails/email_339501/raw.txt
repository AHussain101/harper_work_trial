Hi Marcus,

We received a preliminary carrier quote for your general liability coverage. Estimated annual cost is about $1.3k (includes fees & taxes). To proceed with binding we need:
 - Completed ACORD application (attached)
 - Proof of your personal auto insurance for the service vehicle(s)

You can upload documents here: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/lf-quote-001

If you'd like to discuss payment options or coverage limits (e.g., $100k vs $300k), reply with a good time to talk and I'll arrange a call.

Thanks,
Jordan Kim
