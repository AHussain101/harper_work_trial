[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marcus, this is Mia from Harper. I wanted to confirm a few details on your professional liability request.
MARCUS: Hi Mia, sure—what do you need?
HARPER AGENT: How many licensed clinicians are on staff and are they employees or contractors?
MARCUS: We currently have three clinicians who are W-2 employees; no subcontractors.
HARPER AGENT: Great. And are services primarily on-site or do you offer telehealth as well?
MARCUS: Primarily on-site, with occasional telehealth follow-ups.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks — that helps. We'll include that in the submission and follow up if underwriters request more detail.
MARCUS: Appreciate it. I'll send the staff roster to your upload link.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect, talk soon.
