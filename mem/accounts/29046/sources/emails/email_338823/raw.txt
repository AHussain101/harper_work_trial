Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Marcus,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial responses shortly.

To help us move faster, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, certificates, or additional intake forms) here: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/harborview

Loss runs: a report from your prior insurer covering the last 3 years (or the period you carried coverage). If you need help obtaining these, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Certificates of Insurance (COIs) required by contracts or leases
- Any specific coverage needs or contracts with insurance requirements

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
