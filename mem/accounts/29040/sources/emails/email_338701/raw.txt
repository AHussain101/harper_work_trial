Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Marcus,

Thanks again for speaking with us today — we appreciate the time. We submitted your application to our network of carriers; initial quotes should arrive shortly.

To speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, COIs, etc.) via our secure portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/abcd123

If available, please include loss runs for the past 3 years (or however long you've carried coverage). Loss runs help carriers assess claims history and typically improve turnaround time and pricing.

Also include any contract-specific insurance requirements (COIs) or other coverage needs you want us to address.

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
