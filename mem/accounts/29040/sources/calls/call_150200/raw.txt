HARPER AGENT: This is Mia from Harper. How can I help?

HARPER AGENT: Great, we can help. Please transfer Marcus.
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marcus — I'm Mia. I'll get your workers' comp started. Do you have your EIN handy?

EXTERNAL CONTACT: Three years under our ownership; the location has been around longer.

HARPER AGENT: Okay. Number of employees and payroll?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Two tipped employees; total payroll roughly $15k.
HARPER AGENT: Any alcohol service specifics or entertainment?
