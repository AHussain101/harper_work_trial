Hi Alicia,

Great — once you select a quote, we'll need the following to bind coverage:
- Signed application (or completed ACORD)
- Background check records for current caregivers
- Confirmation of effective date and any specific COI wording required by partners

Please upload documents to the secure portal link below or reply to this email if you prefer to send attachments directly.

Once we receive these, we will finalize binding and issue policy documents.

Regards,
Riley Morgan
