Hi Alicia,

We received preliminary options from carriers for General Liability + Professional Liability (for your nonmedical home care operations). Summary below — these are preliminary and subject to underwriting review and final documents:

Option A — Standard limits (combined GL + PL): premium about $1.3k per year, standard deductible, subjectivities include signed application and background-check confirmation.
Option B — Higher limits (increased aggregate/occurrence): premium about $2.7k per year, additional underwriting items may apply.

You can view the full quote details and carrier documents in the portal: https://portal.harperinsure.com/quotes/greenpath-01

If you'd like, we can schedule a short call to review the differences and pick the best fit.

Thanks,
