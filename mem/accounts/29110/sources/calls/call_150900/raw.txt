[TRANSCRIPT - sanitized]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Neil, this is HARPER EMPLOYEE from Harper — just checking that you received the underwriter's request for testing certificates and loss runs.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes I did. I'm pulling the third-party test reports and will upload them to the portal.
HARPER AGENT: Great — once we receive those we can firm up pricing and territory endorsements. We expect preliminary terms in 24-48 hours after submission.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Sounds good. I'll upload the documents and confirm the subsidiary list by end of day.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks — we'll follow up with the initial quote and a short call to review.
