Hello Neil,

We have an initial program estimate back from the market. High-level estimate: total program cost in the low tens of thousands per year (approximately $18k/year), depending on final territories and subjectivities. Carrier-specific terms and subjectivities still pending.

Payment options and final premium will be provided on the formal quote. To complete the file, please upload requested documents (loss runs, product testing reports, recall plan) via: https://payments.example-insure.com/quote-abc123

If you'd like to discuss the options, reply to this email or call your Harper contact.

Best,
