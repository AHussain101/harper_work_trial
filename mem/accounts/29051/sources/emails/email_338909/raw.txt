Hi Ethel,

Thank you for speaking with our team today. We submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial responses shortly.

To help speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, COIs, signed applications) using the secure portal below.

Upload documents: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/brightfutures-01

Loss runs: If available, please provide loss run statements for the prior 3 years or however long you have carried coverage.

If you have contract-specific insurance requirements (COIs, additional insureds, liquor or transportation exposures), please include those details in your upload.

Best,
