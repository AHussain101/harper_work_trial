[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hello, this is Harper.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi, I'm calling from an affiliate with a customer on my back line in South Carolina.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: This is for Ms. Myers, a vocational heavy-equipment training school.
HARPER AGENT: Great — please transfer her or send the lead details. Do you have the lead code?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: The lead code is LD-48-1001.
HARPER AGENT: Thank you. Please transfer her when ready.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: One moment... Ms. Myers? Are you still there?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I think she disconnected. Sorry about that.
HARPER AGENT: No problem. We can't accept the lead unless the applicant is on the line. If you reconnect her, send the lead back over and we'll take care of it.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Absolutely — I'll reassign the lead. Thanks.
HARPER AGENT: Thank you, have a good shift.
