Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Ms. Myers,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect to receive initial quotes shortly.

To help speed the process, please upload any outstanding documents (loss runs, COIs, or other requirements) to our secure portal: https://portal.harperinsure.com/uploads/lead-LD-48-1001

If you have prior coverage, loss run reports for the last 3 years are especially helpful. If you need assistance obtaining those, let us know and we can help.

If available, please provide:
- Any certificates of insurance (COI) or contract-specific requirements
- Any additional coverage needs or gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
Daniel Park
