Deborah,

We received your Workers' Compensation COI and application. Our underwriting partners will finalize the quote within 24–48 hours. We'll contact you if any subjectivities are required and confirm the effective date once everything is in place. No further action is needed from you at this time unless we request additional docs.

Regards,
Harper Service Team
Harper Insurance
