Preliminary Quote

Hello Daniel,

We received initial pricing from carriers. Based on the submitted operations (mobile-only roadside assistance: tire changes, jump starts, lockouts), expected annual premium is approximately $1.1k to $1.4k depending on chosen limits and deductibles. This is an estimate — final pricing will be provided after underwriting review.

Key assumptions:
- Mobile-only operations, no towing
- No vehicle storage
- No racing or unusual exposures

If these assumptions are correct, please confirm desired limits (we can quote minimum limits or higher limits up to $2M aggregate).

Thanks,
Alex Morgan
