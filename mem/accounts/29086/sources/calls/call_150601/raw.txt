[SUMMARY]
Next Steps: Marcus to upload loss runs and current COI; Harper to submit to carriers and confirm quote timing.

[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marcus, this is Shanika from Harper — I wanted to review the incoming quote and next steps.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi Shanika, thanks. What do you need from me?
HARPER AGENT: If you can upload loss runs (last 3 years) and any current certificate of insurance via the secure portal we sent, that will help finalize the quote. We expect initial carrier terms within 24-48 hours.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Okay, I'll upload those tonight.
HARPER AGENT: Great — once carriers return terms we'll call to review payment options and coverage limits. If you have any questions in the meantime, text or email is fine.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Sounds good, thank you.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks Marcus, talk soon.
