EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi, this is Lindsay at the Commercial Insurance Center. I'm holding for Marcus Lee with Riverbend Tire & Service.

EXTERNAL CONTACT: Marcus, are you available? We show this is a used tire dealer and sometimes you do installations as well.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Can you confirm the exact address number and whether services are provided on-site?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Marcus: Yes, it's the one location and we do some installations occasionally.
HARPER AGENT: Great — thank you. We'll finish intake and follow up for any missing documents. I'm going to call back in a minute because of audio issues.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Okay, thanks.
