Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Marcus,

Thanks for speaking with our intake team. We submitted your application to our panel of carriers and expect initial quotes soon.

To speed the process, please upload any relevant documents (loss runs, current COI, or licensing) via our secure portal: https://portal.harperinsure.com/upload/abc123

Loss runs (last 3 years if available) are especially helpful. If you need assistance obtaining them from a prior carrier, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please also include any contract-specific insurance requirements or additional coverage needs.

Best,
Shanika Patel
