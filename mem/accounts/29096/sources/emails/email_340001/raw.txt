Hello Amelia,

Thanks — we received the uploaded documents (background checks and MVRs). Our intake team is reviewing them and will include them with the submission to carriers.

Next steps: we expect initial carrier responses within 24–48 hours. When quotes arrive, an agent will call to review options and subjectivities.

If anything else comes up, reply to this thread or call our intake line.

Regards,
Jordan Kim
