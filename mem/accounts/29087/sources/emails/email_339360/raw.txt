Hi Steven,

Thanks for confirming details over the phone. To complete submission to underwriting we still need:
- Federal EIN (you can redact digits if sending via text or use secure upload)
- A copy of your current guard license (if available)
- Sample service agreement or contract you use for warehouse accounts

Please upload securely: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/harbor-shield

Once we have these items we will push the file to underwriters and expect initial feedback within 24–48 hours.

Regards,
Maya Patel
