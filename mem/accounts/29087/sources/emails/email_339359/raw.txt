Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Steven,

Thanks for our productive conversation today. Your application has been distributed across our carrier network and initial pricing is expected shortly.

To optimize your rate and expedite underwriting, we'd appreciate the following when convenient:
- Loss runs (claims history for the last 3–5 years)
- Post orders (current assignment protocols)
- Service agreement template (standard contract with liability provisions)
- Experience profile (background documentation)

Additional considerations:
- Any contractual insurance requirements
- Interest in enhanced coverage options

Upload documents securely here: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/harbor-shield

If you prefer, send items to my direct email. We can proceed with underwriting and collect items as needed.

Best,
Jordan Kim
