Hi Ari,

Jonah Blake at Tivoli transferred this lead and confirmed the business details. Underwriters will be reviewing licensing and training documentation. Key underwriting notes captured:
- Initial operations: unarmed (planning to add armed services later)
- Training expectation: ~40 hours/year
- Records retention: 7 years

We'll follow up if any additional documentation is required.

Regards,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
