Summary:
A broker partner (Hartford) and a referral partner connected a Harper agent with the applicant for coverage including Cyber, General Liability, Professional E&O, and Umbrella for an engineering consulting firm in California. The Harper agent collected details on operations, limits requested, and cyber exposure, confirmed two owners/employees, and noted that the firm is primarily civil design work with some site inspections. Applications were completed and will be shopped to carriers.
