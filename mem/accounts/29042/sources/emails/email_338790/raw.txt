Insurance Application Follow-up
Hi Marcus,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial quotes soon.

To help us move quickly, please upload any outstanding documents (loss runs, COIs, signed applications) using the secure portal link below.

Upload documents: https://portal.example-insure.com/doc-upload/abc123

If you need help obtaining loss run reports from a prior carrier, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Certificates of insurance (COI) required for any contracts or leases
- Any additional coverage needs or contract-specific requirements

Best,
Jordan Kim
