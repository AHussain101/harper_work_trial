Hi Alex,

Quick next steps to keep the underwriting moving:

1) Upload completed and signed ACORD application (if not already provided) via: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/blue-sky
2) Provide proof of background checks and drug screening policy for staff/contractors
3) If you will require contractors to carry professional liability, provide minimum COI limits (we note you prefer $1,000,000 per occurrence)

Once we receive these items, carriers can finalize terms. Expect another update within 24-48 business hours after upload.

Thanks,
Jordan Kim
