[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi, this is Jordan from Harper Insurance. How can I help?
CLIENT: Hi Jordan, this is Amanda Porter from Oakridge Nutrition Clinic. I wanted to confirm you received our application and discuss limits for professional liability.
HARPER AGENT: Yes, we have it. Can you confirm number of clinicians and annual patient visits?
CLIENT: We have 10 full-time clinicians, 1 part-time, and roughly 6,000 patient encounters annually. No prior malpractice claims in the last 7 years.
HARPER AGENT: Great. We'll present the standard limits (per-claim and aggregate) and the underwriters' estimated premium. Expect a quote by tomorrow.
CLIENT: Thank you, please email me the packet and a secure payment link when ready.
HARPER AGENT: Will do. Talk soon.
