**Summary:**

Harper Insurance has submitted Maple Home Care Services' insurance application to carriers and expects initial responses soon. Jackson Smythe requests Emily Patterson upload supporting documents (loss runs, prior policies, COIs) to their secure portal. If loss runs aren't available, Harper can request alternative documentation. He also asks for certificates of insurance, employee background check/training details, and any additional coverage or service location information.
