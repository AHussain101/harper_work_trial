[TRANSCRIPT SNIPPET]
HARPER AGENT: Hi, this is Jackson from Harper. I have your submission here for Maple Home Care Services — can I confirm how many caregivers are on active schedules?
CLIENT: Hi, yes — right now we have three regular caregivers and a rotating pool of two substitutes.
HARPER AGENT: Great, thank you. We'll add that to the submission and request loss history; we should have updated quotes in 24–48 hours. We'll email a summary with the estimated premium ranges.
CLIENT: Perfect, thanks. Appreciate it.
