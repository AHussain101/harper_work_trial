Insurance application follow-up

Hi Maya,

Thanks for speaking with us today. We've submitted your workers' comp application to our carrier network and expect initial quotes shortly.

To speed up processing, please upload any requested documents (loss runs if available, COIs, contract requirements) at the secure portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/ghc-123

If you need help obtaining loss runs or completing documents, reply and we'll assist.

Best,
Jordan Kim
