[CALL NOTES]
Harper rep (Jordan Kim) spoke with referral partner and the business owner (Maya Thompson) about a workers' compensation application for home health aide services in Tennessee. Key points captured: business is newly operating (~1 year), owner is sole worker for now, prior policy exists but needs adjustment for contract requirements (request for higher employer liability limits). Owner will send the contract requirements and W-9; EIN and other sensitive identifiers were redacted from the transcript for privacy. Harper will submit to carriers and follow up with quotes.
