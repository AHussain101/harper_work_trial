Hello Samuel,

We reviewed the RPS offer and prepared a client proposal. Summary:
- Estimated total due (including fees/taxes): about $4.5k
- Broker service fee: around $200
- Total due: around $4.7k

Payment options and binding instructions are in the attachments. You can review documents and e-sign here: https://payments.example-insure.com/quote-NS-4821

Next steps: please upload driver MVRs and sign the application to finalize. Once documents are in, we can bind and provide evidence of coverage.

Thanks,
Alex Park
