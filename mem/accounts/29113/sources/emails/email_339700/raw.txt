Preliminary Quote Estimate

Hi Khalil,

Per our conversation, attached is a preliminary estimate for a single-truck commercial auto policy with state-minimum liability. Based on the information provided (local hauling, single operator, no prior commercial auto history), you can expect an estimated annual premium in the range of about $3.2k–$3.8k. This estimate is subject to final underwriting and vehicle valuation.

Next steps:
- Confirm VIN and ownership documents once purchase completes
- Upload driver MVR or consent form
- Decide on additional coverages (cargo, higher limits) if desired
