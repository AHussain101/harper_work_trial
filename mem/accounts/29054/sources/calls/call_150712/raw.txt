[SUMMARY]
Outbound follow-up call to review initial quote and confirm next steps for binding.

[CONCISE TRANSCRIPT - sanitized]
Harper Agent: Hi Emma, this is Lia Park from Harper Insurance calling about your quote for Brightview Adult Day Center. Do you have a few minutes?
Client: Yes, I do.
Harper Agent: Great — we sent an estimated quote earlier today. I wanted to confirm that loss runs and a signed application will allow us to bind quickly. Do you have those documents available?
Client: I can upload the signed form and request loss runs from the prior carrier; it may take a day.
Harper Agent: That's perfect. Once we have those, we can finalize the premium and send payment options. Would you prefer a single bill or a monthly plan?
Client: Monthly would be easier.
Harper Agent: Noted. We'll include monthly payment options in the final paperwork and follow up by email.
Client: Thanks, Lia.
