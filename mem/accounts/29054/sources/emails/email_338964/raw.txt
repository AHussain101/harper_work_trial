Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Emma,

Thank you for speaking with us today. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial responses soon.

To help speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, COIs, or other underwriting items) via our secure portal.

Requested items often include:
- Loss runs (last 3 years if available)
- Any certificate of insurance requirements for leases or contracts
- Details on staffing, licenses, and any recent inspections

If you need help collecting loss runs or documents, reply and we'll assist.

Best,
Jordan Kim
