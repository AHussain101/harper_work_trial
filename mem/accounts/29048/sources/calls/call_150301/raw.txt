[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Thank you for calling Harper. This is Ashley.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi, Ashley — this is Jessica at Tivoli. I have Olivia on the line in Connecticut; she's forming soap products under her own label.
HARPER AGENT: Great — transfer her over and I'll assist.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Olivia? You're on with Ashley from Harper now.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hello, Olivia?
CLIENT (Olivia): Hi, Ashley — thanks for taking this. I'm looking for umbrella and professional liability so I can participate in a fulfillment program.
HARPER AGENT: We can help. Can you confirm your company name and a quick product description?
CLIENT (Olivia): Brookside Botanicals LLC — artisan handmade soaps. We also resell a few accessory items like soap dishes, but the soaps are our main product.
HARPER AGENT: Okay. Do you currently carry general liability?
CLIENT (Olivia): Yes — my COI lists Great American Alliance Insurance Company.
HARPER AGENT: Any prior claims?
CLIENT (Olivia): No claims.
HARPER AGENT: Estimated revenue?
CLIENT (Olivia): Projected around $750k next year.
HARPER AGENT: Payroll?
CLIENT (Olivia): About $100.5k.
HARPER AGENT: Understood. The program you mentioned wants umbrella on an occurrence basis at roughly $2.0M excess and professional liability about $1.0M per claim — we can shop that but it may take 24–48 hours. We'll mark this urgent.
CLIENT (Olivia): That would be great — thank you.
HARPER AGENT: I'll submit and follow up via email. Expect an email from Harper with next steps.
CLIENT (Olivia): Email is olivia.grant@brooksidebotanicals.com — thanks so much.
HARPER AGENT: You're welcome. Have a good day.
