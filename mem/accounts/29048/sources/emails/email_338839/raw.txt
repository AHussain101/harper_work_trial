Insurance Application Follow-up 
 Hi Olivia, 

 Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today — we appreciated the overview of your operations. 

 We've submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial quotes shortly. To help speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, product labels, COIs) to our secure portal. 

 Loss runs: if available, please provide claim history for the last 3 years (or for the time you've carried coverage). If you need help obtaining these, we're happy to assist. 

 If available, please provide: 
 - Insurance Requirements: Any certificates of insurance (COI) or specific coverage requirements you need to meet for contracts or warehouses. 
 - Product documentation: sample labels, ingredient lists, or safety/usage instructions. 
 - Additional Coverage Needs: Any other coverage gaps you'd like us to address. 

 Best,
 Ashley Myers
