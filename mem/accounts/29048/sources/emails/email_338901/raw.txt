Hello Olivia,

Underwriting review noted two quick items before finalizing terms:
1) Please upload a high-resolution product label for the finished soap SKU(s). 
2) Please provide a current Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the primary soap formulation.

Providing these will help expedite quoting. If you'd prefer, you can email the files directly to ashley.myers@harperinsure.com or upload via our portal.

Thanks,
Harper Underwriting (on behalf of carrier review team)
