[TRANSCRIPT HIGHLIGHTS]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marisol, this is Daniel from Harper Insurance following up on your workers' comp intake.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi Daniel, yes I was just pulled over and can talk now for a couple minutes.
HARPER AGENT: Great — can you confirm if you prefer workers' comp for owners to be excluded, and share an estimate of annual payroll for drivers?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Owners excluded. Payroll for drivers roughly $30k annually total.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks — can you email or upload your EIN and a short driver roster to our upload portal? I'll hold on scheduling a full review until we have those.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I'll upload it this afternoon. Thanks for the follow-up.
HARPER AGENT: Appreciate it. We'll watch for the upload and reach back with any carrier questions.
