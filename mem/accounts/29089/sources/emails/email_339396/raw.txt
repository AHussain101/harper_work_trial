Hello Marisol,

Welcome — this is a quick follow-up to confirm the details we discussed by phone and to request the missing items needed to finish the workers' compensation application:

Requested items:
- Federal EIN (or SSN for sole proprietors)
- Most recent payroll totals and number of drivers
- Any recent claims or incidents (past 3 years)

You can reply directly to this email or upload files here: https://portal.harperinsure.example/upload

If it's easier, reply to this thread with a good time for a 10-minute call and we'll complete the intake with you.

Thanks,
Sam Wright
