Friendly reminder: documents needed to continue underwriting

Hi Marcus,

Just checking in — underwriting has requested prior policy declarations or loss runs if you have them. Providing these typically speeds final quotes.

If you don't have loss runs, let us know the dates and carriers for prior coverage and we can try to request them on your behalf.

Regards,
