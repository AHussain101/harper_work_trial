Welcome to Harper Insurance

Hi Marcus,

Welcome — we're glad to be working with SafeGuard Solutions LLC. To get a workers' compensation quote started, could you confirm:
1) State(s) where you have employees
2) Estimated annual payroll for W-2 employees
3) Approximate number of full-time and part-time staff

A member of our underwriting team will follow up once we have those details. If you prefer, reply to this email with the info and attach any prior policy declarations pages.

Thanks,
Jordan Kim
Harper Insurance
