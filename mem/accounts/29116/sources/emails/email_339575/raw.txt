Insurance Application Follow-up
Hi Marcus,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We submitted your intake to our carrier network and expect initial responses shortly.

To help us move faster, please upload any existing loss runs (if you have prior coverage) and any certificates of insurance or contract requirements you need met. If you need help getting loss runs from a prior carrier, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Certificates of insurance (COIs) or specific coverage requirements
- Any additional coverage needs or gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
Jordan Kim
CEO & Co-founder
