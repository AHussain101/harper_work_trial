Hi Naomi,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me earlier regarding your new care home business in Delaware. I appreciate you sharing details about your plans to provide non-medical support for adults with mobility and daily living needs.

To ensure we secure the right coverage and provide you with an accurate quote, could you provide the following in writing?
- A brief description of services provided (personal care, companion services, transportation, medication reminders, etc.)
- Typical client profile (age ranges, mobility or cognitive needs)
- Estimated number of clients served per week and anticipated staffing levels
- Any specific coverages you think you'll need (General Liability, Professional Liability, Abuse & Molestation, Workers' Compensation)
- Any existing policies or prior claims history (loss runs) if available

If you'd like, I can schedule a short follow-up call to review these items together. You can also upload documents securely via our portal (we will send a secure link if you prefer).

Best regards,

Jordan Kim
