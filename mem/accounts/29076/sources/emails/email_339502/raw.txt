Hi Naomi,

We have a preliminary quote based on the information provided. This is an initial estimate and subject to underwriting review once we receive the requested documents.

Coverage included (examples):
- General Liability: recommended limits up to $1M/$2M aggregate
- Professional Liability: coverage for care-related professional exposures
- Abuse & Molestation coverage (recommended endorsement)

Estimated premium: around $4.2k annually (this is a rounded estimate; final premium may vary once underwriters review loss runs and staffing details).

To review and pay (or set up a payment plan), please use our secure portal: https://payments.example-insure.com/quote-xy123

If you'd like to discuss payment options or adjust limits, I can schedule a 15-minute call.

Thanks,
