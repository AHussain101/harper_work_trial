Hello Naomi,

Following up on our call — attached is a short intake checklist to help underwriters understand your operations. If you prefer, you can upload documents securely using this synthetic portal link: https://portal.example-insure.com/uploads/abc123

Requested items:
- Services overview (daily tasks, any medication assistance, transportation)
- Client demographics and typical care plans
- Staff roster and training/certificate summaries
- Any existing insurance policies (loss runs or declarations page)

Once we receive these items we will validate eligibility and begin obtaining preliminary quotes. If you need help filling out the checklist, let me know and I can walk you through it on a quick call.

Thanks,

Priya Patel
