Hi Priya,

Thanks — overview below:
- Services: non-medical personal care, assistance with activities of daily living, transportation to appointments, and regular wellness checks. We do not provide invasive medical procedures.
- Clients: primarily adults with mobility limitations and some cognitive impairment; typically older adults.
- Staffing: currently planning for 3 caregivers and an owner/operator; we expect to serve about 8–10 regular clients in the first few months.
- Prior insurance: none in place yet. No prior claims to report.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Best,

Naomi Brooks
Owner
Willow Grove Home Care
