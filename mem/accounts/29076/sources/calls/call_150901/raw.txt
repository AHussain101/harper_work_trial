[SUMMARY]
Harper agent Priya Patel called to review the preliminary quote and payment options with Naomi. Discussed coverage limits and next steps to bind.

[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Naomi, this is Priya at Harper — I wanted to review the preliminary quote and your options.
CLIENT: Hi Priya — yes, I saw the estimate in my email.
HARPER AGENT: The estimate is a rounded figure; if you'd like higher professional limits or additional endorsements we can update the quote. When you upload the staff training and client agreements, underwriting can finalize the premium.
CLIENT: Okay — I'll upload those this afternoon.
HARPER AGENT: Great. Once underwriting signs off, we can proceed to bind and I'll send the policy documents.
