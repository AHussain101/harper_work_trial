Insurance application follow-up

Hi David,

Thanks for speaking with us today—appreciate your time. We've submitted your application to our carrier panel and expect initial quotes shortly. To speed the process, please upload any requested documents to the secure portal below:

https://portal.example-mga.com/applications/48-1032/documents

If our intake team requested it, please provide loss runs covering the last 3 years (or however long you have carried this coverage). Loss runs help underwriters evaluate claims history and can improve turnaround time and pricing.

If available, please include:
- Certificates of insurance (COI) required by any contracts or landlords
- Any additional coverage needs or special endorsements you want us to consider

Best,
Avery Collins
