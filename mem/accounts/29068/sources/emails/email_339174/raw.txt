Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Scott,

Thank you for speaking with us today. We submitted your workers' compensation application to our panel of carriers and expect initial quotes soon.

To speed the process, please upload any recent payroll reports, proof of subcontractor agreements, and any loss runs (if available) for the last three years. If you need help obtaining loss runs, reply and we'll assist.

You can upload documents securely via the link we sent in the intake message.

Best,
Jordan Kim
