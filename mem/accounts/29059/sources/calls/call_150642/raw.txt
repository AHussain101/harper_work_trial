HARPER AGENT: Hi, this is Elena from Harper Insurance. Am I speaking with Erin?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks — I'm going to confirm a few details so we can get accurate quotes. You mentioned prenatal/postpartum services and elective ultrasound (non-diagnostic), correct?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Correct. We also do Pilates, massage and chiropractic sessions; the clinicians carry their own professional coverage.
HARPER AGENT: Do you own the building or lease?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Lease.
HARPER AGENT: Any past commercial coverage or claims?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: No commercial coverage to date, no claims.
HARPER AGENT: Do you have an EIN to include on the application?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I believe it's 48-1032 (synthetic sample).
HARPER AGENT: Great. For limits I suggest starting with a $1,000,000 occurrence limit; we can adjust later if needed.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: That sounds good.
HARPER AGENT: I'll submit this to carriers now and send the quote to your email. Expect an email and a follow-up text within 24-48 hours.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Thank you — appreciate it.
