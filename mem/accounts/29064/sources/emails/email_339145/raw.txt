Insurance application follow-up

Hi Becca,

Thanks again for speaking with us today — we appreciate the overview of your device and operations. We've submitted your application to our network of underwriters and expect initial interest and preliminary quotes in 48–72 hours.

Next steps:
- Please upload any prior insurance loss runs (last 3 years) if available.
- If you have contract/tenant COI requirements or specific coverage limits, please forward those documents or a short note describing them.
- If you have product specification sheets or basic lab handling procedures, those help underwriters evaluate the product risk quickly.

Upload documents securely here: https://portal.harperinsure.com/upload/summit-xxxx (synthetic link)

If you need help retrieving loss runs or gathering documents, reply and we'll assist.

Best,
Jordan Kim
