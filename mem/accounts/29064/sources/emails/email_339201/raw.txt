Dear Jordan,

USLI is showing preliminary interest for the Summit BioDevices submission. We can provide a General Liability quote for a research‑device manufacturer. Preliminary premium indications are in the mid single‑thousands range (around $8.0k–$9.0k annual premium) depending on final exposures and subjectivities.

Please have the insured confirm:
- Annual production and sales estimate
- Any product recall or product‑related claims history
- Copies of product specification and lab use instructions

We will follow up with a formal packet if those items are provided.

Regards,
Lauren Smith
USLI
