[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Becca, this is Jordan at Harper Insurance calling to confirm we received your submission and to check whether you had a product spec sheet or any prior claims to share.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi Jordan — yes, I uploaded a short spec sheet and will send a brief note about production volumes.
HARPER AGENT: Great. That will help underwriters. We'll ping you if carriers have any questions; otherwise expect preliminary indications in 48–72 hours.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Perfect, thanks for the call.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks — talk soon.
