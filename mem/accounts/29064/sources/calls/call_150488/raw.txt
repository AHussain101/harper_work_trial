[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Thank you for calling Harper Insurance — this is Stacia. How can I help?
EXTERNAL CONTACT (Tivoli rep): Hello, I have a client for you. She's in Utah looking for general liability and workers' comp for a small device company.
HARPER AGENT: Great — what's the company name?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Summit BioDevices (spelled out).
HARPER AGENT: Perfect. Please transfer the owner over when ready.

HARPER AGENT: Hi Becca, this is Stacia at Harper. Can you describe your operations so I pull the correct application?
EXTERNAL CONTACT (Becca): Sure. We manufacture a small benchtop research device for laboratory use. It's a compact plastic unit that processes small biological samples and uses single‑use consumable chips.
HARPER AGENT: That helps a lot — I'll use that wording for the submission. If you have a product spec sheet or sample handling instructions, please upload them. Also, loss runs (if any) will help speed carrier review.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Okay, I'll get those.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks — we'll start the submission and expect initial responses in about 2–3 business days.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Appreciate it. Thank you.
HARPER AGENT: You're welcome — have a good day.
