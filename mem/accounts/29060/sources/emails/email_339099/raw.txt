Insurance Application Follow-up
Hi Karen,

Thank you for speaking with us today. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial quotes shortly.

To help speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, COIs, or contract insurance requirements) at the secure upload portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/abcd

Loss runs (if available) for the past 3 years are most helpful. If you need assistance obtaining them, we can help.

If available, please provide:
- Certificates of Insurance or contract-specific requirements
- Any additional coverage needs or gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
Natalie Kim
