Hi Karen,

Underwriters have asked for a few site photos (access points, erosion controls, and typical lot conditions) and a short copy of the lot plan or grading plan if available. You can upload those to the same portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/abcd

If it's easier, reply to this email and we can arrange an agent to come by for a short site visit.

Thanks,
Natalie Kim
