Insurance Application Follow-up
Hi Liam,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. We submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial responses shortly.

To help us move faster, please upload a few items if available:
- Recent loss runs (last 3 years or however long you've carried coverage)
- Any certificates of insurance (COI) or contract/lease insurance requirements
- Any other coverage needs or gaps you want us to address

You may upload documents to our secure intake portal: https://uploads.example-insure.com/summit-portal (synthetic link).

If you need assistance obtaining loss runs, let us know and we can help contact prior carriers.

Best,
Jordan Kim
