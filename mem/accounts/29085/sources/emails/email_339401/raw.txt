Hi Liam,

Preliminary quote returned from carriers for General Liability (including premises/liquor exposure). High-level numbers (rounded estimates):
- Annual premium: about $6.2k
- Estimated fees & taxes: around $200–$300
- Total estimated first year cost: roughly $6.4k–$6.6k

We can offer an installment plan; typical down payment would be about 20% (roughly $1.2k–$1.4k) with monthly options available.

If you want us to request any changes to limits or deductibles before binding, reply with the details and we'll update the submission.

Thanks,
