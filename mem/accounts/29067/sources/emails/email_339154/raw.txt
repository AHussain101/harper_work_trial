Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Alex,

Thanks for speaking with us. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial quotes in about 24–48 hours. To help speed the process, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, signed applications, COIs) via our secure portal: https://portal.harperinsure.com/upload/lincoln-123

If loss runs are requested, please provide the last 3 years (or however long you carried the coverage). If you need help obtaining them, reply and we can assist.

If available, please also provide:
- Any certificate of insurance (COI) requirements
- Any additional coverage needs or gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
Samira Khan
Account Manager
