Summary:
A referral from a broker was transferred to Harper. The contact (Alex) described Lincoln Auto Traders as a small used car lot at 12345 Main St, Anytown, AL. They are doing an ownership transfer; the new owner is Emma Johnson. There will be two authorized drivers (owner and one employee). They plan to apply for a dealer's license and expect to request up to 6 dealer plates. Estimated annual sales are around $40k. No salvage vehicles, no in-house financing. They prefer state minimum coverage for now. Harper will prepare and submit the application to carriers and provide quotes within 24–48 hours.
