Hi Ethan,

We received initial responses from two carriers. Summary:
- RPS: Premium around $4.8k (total cost about $5.1k) — General Liability $1M/$2M. Subjectivities include standard product liability disclosures and confirmation of manufacturers' quality testing.
- USLI: Premium around $6.2k (total cost about $6.7k) — competitive option with similar limits.

Both quotes are preliminary and subject to formal paperwork. You can review the carrier summaries on our portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/quotes/blue-sky-01

Let me know which option you'd like us to move forward with or if you want us to seek additional appetite for broader product liability terms.

Thanks,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
