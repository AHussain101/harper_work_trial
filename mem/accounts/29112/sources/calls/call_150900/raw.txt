[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Ethan, this is Maya from Harper following up — we have preliminary quotes from RPS and USLI. Do you have a moment to discuss which option you prefer?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, I can talk now.
HARPER AGENT: RPS is lower premium, and USLI provides slightly broader standard wording for product liability. If you can upload the manufacturer's QA reports, we can clear the subjectivities quickly.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I'll upload the QA report today and confirm which carrier to move forward with.
HARPER AGENT: Great — once we have that, we'll confirm binding steps and email the policy paperwork.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Sounds good, thanks.
HARPER AGENT: Thank you, Ethan. We'll be in touch.
