[SUMMARY]
Follow-up call to confirm receipt of licensing documents and program requirements; scheduled next steps to upload vehicle details and prior policy declaration pages.

[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Sonia, this is Jordan from Harper following up — did you get a chance to upload the licensing and requirement letter?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, I uploaded the files to the secure portal a few minutes ago.
HARPER AGENT: Great. Could you also send the vehicle year/make/model and we will record a masked VIN for quoting? We only need the last 4 digits for our initial submission.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Sure — I'll send that via the secure form.
HARPER AGENT: Excellent. We'll move forward with submissions and call back with any clarifying questions.
