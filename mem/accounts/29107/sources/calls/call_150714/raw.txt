## Summary:
Jordan (Harper) assisted Sonia from Seabreeze Child Development Center (home-based daycare) to discuss attaching an umbrella/excess policy (requested amount: about $5.6M). Licensing and program requirements were reviewed; center capacity and typical daily attendance noted (licensed for 14, typically 10–12 in attendance). The client will provide the required program/contract paperwork and prior policy declarations. Harper will prepare GL and umbrella submissions and explore commercial auto separately.

[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi, this is Jordan from Harper Insurance. How can I help you today?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi, this is Sonia. I'm calling about getting an umbrella liability policy for my home daycare in California.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks, Sonia. Can you confirm your licensing and the program requirement letter so we can present it to carriers?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes. I have the state license and the document that lists the liability limits required. I'll upload that to the portal.
HARPER AGENT: Great. To place an umbrella, we generally need the underlying General Liability with the same carrier; if your current carrier can't provide the umbrella, we'll quote a new GL that can accept the excess.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: My current carrier (Next Insurance) can't provide the umbrella.
HARPER AGENT: Understood. We'll submit to carriers that can attach the umbrella. You also mentioned occasional school pickups—do you transport children with a personal vehicle?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I do some pick-ups. I'll provide the vehicle details separately; please redact VIN for notes.
HARPER AGENT: That works. We'll request the vehicle year/make/model and only store a masked VIN for quoting.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Okay. Also, I have prior abuse/molestation coverage noted on my previous policy; I'll include the declarations when I upload.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect—please upload the declarations and the program requirement. We'll assemble GL, umbrella, and a separate commercial auto quote and reach back out within 24–48 hours.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Thank you.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks, Sonia. We'll be in touch.
