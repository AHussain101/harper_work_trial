Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Sonia,

Thanks for taking the time to speak with our team today. We submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial responses soon.

To help speed the process, please upload any of the items requested by our intake team (for example: loss runs, licensing documentation, or the program requirement letter). If you need help obtaining loss runs from a prior insurer, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Insurance requirements (COIs or contractual insurance limits)
- Any additional coverage needs or gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
Jordan Kim
