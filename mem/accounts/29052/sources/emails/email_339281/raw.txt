Harper team,

Thanks for the submission for Elm Street Transit LLC. We have reviewed the initial details and can proceed with quoting GL coverage. A few clarifying questions for the insured:

- Please confirm estimated annual mileage per vehicle (roughly)
- Confirm vehicle is a standard sedan (yes/no)

Quote reference: RPS-4821 (synthetic reference)

Regards,
Lloyd Mattson
