Insurance Application Follow-up
Hi Marcus,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today — we appreciated learning more about your new group home. We've submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial responses in the next 24–48 business hours.

To help us move quickly, please upload any available documents (proof of inspection readiness, staffing plan, and any facility policies) to the portal below:

https://portal.example-insure.com/upload

If our intake team requested it, please provide a Loss Run Statement (if you previously carried similar coverage) or any state inspection forms once available. Loss runs document claim history and help underwriters assess pricing and eligibility.

If available, please provide:
- Insurance requirements (COI or specific contractual coverage needs)
- Additional coverage needs or concerns

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
