**Subject:** RE: Harper Insurance - MapleBridge Staffing Insurance Quote Update
**From:** harper_employee@harperinsure.com
**To:** rachel.m@maplebridgestaffing.example

**Summary:**

Harper Insurance has submitted MapleBridge Staffing's application to carriers and expects initial responses soon. Rachel must upload documents via secure portal: loss runs (last 3 years preferred), certificates of insurance, and prior policies. She should also provide any contract-specific insurance requirements (limits, additional insured language) to confirm binding eligibility. Harper can assist with obtaining loss runs if needed.
