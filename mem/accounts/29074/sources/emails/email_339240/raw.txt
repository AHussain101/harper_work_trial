Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Rachel,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today — we appreciated the overview of your business. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial responses shortly.

To keep things moving, please upload the requested documents (loss runs, COIs, any prior policies) via our secure portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload

Loss runs for the last 3 years (or however long you've carried coverage) are especially helpful and speed underwriting. If you need assistance requesting them, we can help.

Also please include any contract-specific insurance requirements (limits, additional insured language) so we can confirm binding eligibility.

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
