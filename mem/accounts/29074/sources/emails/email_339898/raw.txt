Submission Summary

Overview:
MapleBridge Staffing is a first-year staffing firm seeking a comprehensive package: Cyber Liability, E&O/Professional Liability, General Liability, Employer's Liability, Crime, and a high-limit Umbrella (client requires ~ $10M aggregate). First-year revenue reported at roughly $500k and payroll around $300k.

Business operations:
- Focus on clerical and professional placements (no medical/IT staffing)
- 10 internal employees supporting placement operations
- Multi-state placement capability; client contracts require rapid COI issuance

Insurance status & history:
- New business with no prior insurance history on file
- Owner (Rachel Manning) has extensive staffing experience and needs quick COI turnaround to meet client contracts

Underwriting considerations:
- High umbrella/aggregate limits requested by clients (~$10M)
- Loss runs from any prior carrier are required before binding

Next steps: obtain loss runs and any contract COI language, then activate carrier submissions. Expect initial carrier responses within 24–72 hours after loss runs are received.

Thanks,
HARPER TEAM
