**Summary:**

Harper Insurance received Maple Bridge Staffing's coverage details but needs 3 years of loss run statements to proceed with underwriting and pricing. Once received, they expect to provide initial quotes within 24–48 hours. The client can upload documents to a portal or request assistance obtaining loss runs from their prior carrier.
