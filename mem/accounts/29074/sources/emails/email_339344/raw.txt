Hi Rachel,

Thanks for the quick turnaround and for providing the requested coverage details. We received your coverage list and it helps underwriters assess the account.

What we still need to proceed:
1) Loss run statements for the last 3 years (or however long you've carried coverage). These are critical for underwriting and pricing.

Once we have loss runs we typically activate carrier outreach and expect initial quotes within 24–48 hours.

If you need help requesting loss runs from a prior carrier, reply to this message and we’ll assist. You can also upload documents here: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload

Best,
HARPER EMPLOYEE
