Hi Marcus,

Quick reminder: to finalize the workers' comp quote we need a payroll snapshot for the driver and the signed application. You can upload both here: https://portal.example-insure.com/uploads/lakeside-123

If you prefer to email the documents directly, reply and I'll provide a secure attachment option.

Thanks,
Talia Green
