Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Marcus,

Thanks again for speaking with us today. We've submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial responses shortly. To speed quoting, please upload any available loss runs (last 3 years if available), COIs required by customers, and any additional coverage notes (e.g., hired/non-owned auto details).

Secure upload portal: https://portal.example-insure.com/uploads/lakeside-123

If you need help locating prior loss runs, reply and we can assist.

Best,
Talia Green
