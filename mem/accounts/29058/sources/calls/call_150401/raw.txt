[SUMMARY]
Follow-up call to confirm quote details and documents to bind.

[TRANSCRIPT — sanitized]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marcus, this is Talia at Harper following up — we received a preliminary workers' comp estimate for your account.
OWNER: Great, what's next?
HARPER AGENT: We just need a recent payroll snapshot for your driver and your preferred effective date. Once received, underwriting will finalize and we can send binding instructions and a secure payment link.
OWNER: I'll upload payroll today and confirm an effective date.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect — I will watch for the upload and follow up once underwriting confirms. Thanks Marcus.
