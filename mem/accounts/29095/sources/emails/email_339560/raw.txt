Hi Chris,

To proceed with binding, carriers have requested:
- Loss runs for the last 3 years (request from your prior carrier if needed)
- A simple driver list for employees who operate vehicles (name and year of birth only)

If you can upload those to: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload/auto-quote-01 we can share them with the carrier and finalize quickly.

If you need help requesting loss runs from Travelers, reply and we can assist.

Regards,
Dakotah Reed
