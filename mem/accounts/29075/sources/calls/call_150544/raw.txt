[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: This is Jamie from Harper Insurance.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hello — this is a rep from LeadPartner, I have Marco on the line. Sorry about the hold.
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marco — thanks for waiting. I understand you're calling about workers' compensation for your flatbed trucking business.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes. I had a policy but it was canceled in May, and now there's an independent contractor dispute.
HARPER AGENT: Got it. A few quick questions so we can get an initial quote. How many full-time employees do you have?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: One full-time driver and a second part-time driver — total drivers two, power units three.
HARPER AGENT: Do you operate solely in California?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, just California.
HARPER AGENT: Any subcontractors now?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Not currently — we had one in the past that is related to the claim, but not ongoing.
HARPER AGENT: Understood. For our records, please upload your prior declarations page, any cancellation notice you received, your MCS-150, and the attorney letter regarding the dispute. Also note: we recorded your EIN as ending in 6182; please confirm by uploading the official document.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Sure — I'll upload those now.
HARPER AGENT: Great. We'll get this to underwriting and follow up within 48 hours after they review the documents.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Thank you — phone is the best way to reach me.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect. We'll call when we have updates.
