[SUMMARY]
Quick follow-up call from Jamie to confirm documents were uploaded and to set expectations for underwriting timeline.

[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Marco — this is Jamie at Harper following up. Did you manage to upload the MCS-150 and attorney letter?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, I uploaded both and the prior declarations page this morning.
HARPER AGENT: Great — underwriting will review and may request clarifications about the contractor incident. We expect initial carrier quotes in about 24–48 hours once they finish their review.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Okay, thank you — I'll watch my email and phone.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect. If you have any additional documentation, upload it to the same portal and we will add it to the file.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Will do.
HARPER AGENT: Thank you, Marco. Bye.
