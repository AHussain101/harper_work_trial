Marco,

Thanks — we received the MCS-150 and the correspondence from your attorney. We've uploaded both to your file and forwarded them to underwriting for review.

Note: you mentioned the EIN. For security we note it as EIN ending in 6182 on file. If underwriting needs the full copy for verification, please upload an image of the EIN confirmation or business tax letter.

We'll update you within 24–48 hours on any carrier requests or next steps.

Best,
Jamie Park
Harper Insurance
