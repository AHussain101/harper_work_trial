Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Marco,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today — we appreciate it. We submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial responses shortly.

To help us move things along, please upload the documents we requested (proof of prior coverage, MCS-150, and any legal correspondence) using our secure portal: https://portal.harperinsure.com/upload/rising-transport

If our intake team requested it, please provide loss runs for the last 3 years or whatever period you have available. If you need help obtaining loss runs, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please also provide:
- Any certificate of insurance (COI) requirements you must meet for contracts
- Any additional coverage needs or known exposures

Best,
Jamie Park
