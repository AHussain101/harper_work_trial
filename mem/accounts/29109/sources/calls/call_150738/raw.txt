Summary:
Harper agent followed up with the owner to re-run a quote after the client reported earlier information may have been incorrect. Client indicated prior quote seemed high (around $15k) and agreed to provide corrected details so Harper can attempt a revised quote.

[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi — this is HARPER EMPLOYEE with Harper Insurance. How are you?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I'm good.
HARPER AGENT: I see you were looking for general liability for Boardman Diner & Café. We didn't find a completed application in the channel, so I'm following up.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I spoke with someone earlier but I think I gave wrong info; the quote came back much higher than expected — about fifteen thousand.
HARPER AGENT: Okay — if you're willing, we can take corrected numbers and try again. Can you confirm payroll and any recent claims?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes, I can send those. Try again please.
HARPER AGENT: Great, we'll re-run and follow up.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Thank you.
