[TRANSCRIPT]
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hi — this is Wei at Boardman Diner & Café. I had a question about the policy — will that cover incidents related to the building we lease?
HARPER AGENT: General Liability can include rented premises coverage; we'll confirm limits in the quote. We can also issue a COI for your landlord. Please send lease copy and landlord contact for certificate issuance.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Great — I'll upload the lease and ask for a COI template.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect, we'll email the COI template and update the file.
