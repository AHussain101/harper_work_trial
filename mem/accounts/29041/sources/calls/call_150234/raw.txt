[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi — Brandt Insurance, this is Chris.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Hello, this is Jamalia with Tivoli. I have a customer from California on my back line who is looking for workers' comp. He's a dentist.
HARPER AGENT: Okay, we can take the lead. Please transfer him over.
HARPER AGENT: Hello — this is Chris with Harper Insurance. How are you?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: I'm doing fine.
HARPER AGENT: I understand you're looking for workers' compensation for yourself. Can I confirm your name?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes — Dr. Marcus Reed.
HARPER AGENT: Thanks. What's the best number to reach you on file?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: That number is on file with us.
HARPER AGENT: Is this your first workers' comp policy?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes — I'm looking for minimal coverage, essentially an officer-excluded policy to satisfy a contract requirement.
HARPER AGENT: Got it. We'll note the request for minimal limits and officer exclusion. Do you have an EIN on file?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Yes — EIN: 99-XX-9536.
HARPER AGENT: Great. Any subcontractors?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: No — I'm the only one.
HARPER AGENT: Any claims history?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: No.
HARPER AGENT: Do you need the policy to start immediately?
EXTERNAL CONTACT: As soon as possible.
HARPER AGENT: Okay. I'll transfer this to underwriting and they'll reach out by email and phone, and we'll flag the cancellation/short-term policy question for service to confirm whether there are early-cancellation fees.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Thanks. Email is best — usually available around midday Pacific or after 6 PM.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect. We'll be in touch within 24 hours.
EXTERNAL CONTACT: Thank you. Bye.
