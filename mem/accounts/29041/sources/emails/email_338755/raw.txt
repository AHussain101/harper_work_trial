Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Dr. Reed,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today — we appreciated learning about your practice.

We submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial quotes shortly.

To help us move faster, please upload any requested documents (loss runs, COIs, or contract insurance requirements) via the secure upload link in your portal.

If you need help getting loss runs from a prior carrier, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Certificates of insurance (COI) or any contract-specific coverage needs
- Any additional coverage gaps you'd like us to address

Best,
HARPER_EMPLOYEE
