Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Isabella Rivera,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today — we appreciated the overview of your childcare operation.

We've submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect initial quote options shortly. To help us continue, please upload the requested documents (state childcare license, emergency contacts, and any prior policy or loss runs) using our secure upload portal:

https://portal.harperinsure.com/upload/SD-789

Loss runs (if applicable) are reports from prior insurers that document any claims. If you need help obtaining loss runs, reply to this email and we'll assist.

If available, please include:
- Certificates of insurance (COI) or contract-specific insurance requirements
- Any additional coverage needs or specific named-insured requirements

Best regards,
Maya Brooks
