Hello Isabella,

Quick checklist to keep your application on track:
• Upload a copy of your state childcare license.
• Provide a short list (name + phone) of 2 emergency contacts and any alternate caregivers.
• If you have a sample parent agreement or incident reporting policy, that helps underwriting.

Upload securely: https://portal.harperinsure.com/upload/SD-790

Once we have these items, underwriting can finalize quote options — typically within 24–48 hours of receiving documents.

Thanks,
