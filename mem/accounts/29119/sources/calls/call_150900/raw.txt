[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi, this is Jordan at Harper Insurance — how can I help?
CLIENT: Hi Jordan, this is Maya at Sunny Days Childcare. I just wanted to confirm you got our application and ask what the next steps are.
HARPER AGENT: Yes — we received it and submitted to a few carriers. We'll ask for the childcare endorsements and any abuse/molestation wording. Can you confirm average daily attendance and staff counts?
CLIENT: We typically have about 18–22 children and 5 staff on most days.
HARPER AGENT: Great — that helps. If you can upload the staff background summaries and a brief safety plan, underwriting will review faster. Expect preliminary indications in 24–72 hours.
CLIENT: Sounds good. I'll upload those today. Thanks.
HARPER AGENT: Thank you, Maya. We’ll be in touch when the carriers respond.
