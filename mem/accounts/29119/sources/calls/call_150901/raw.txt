[SUMMARY]
- Harper outbound call to confirm document upload and answer a question about background checks.

[TRANSCRIPT]
HARPER AGENT: Hi Maya, this is Jordan from Harper Insurance following up — did you have a chance to upload the staff background summaries?
CLIENT: Hey Jordan — yes, I uploaded a summary but not full files yet. Are summary reports sufficient?
HARPER AGENT: For initial underwriting a summary noting dates and types of background checks is okay; final bind will need documentation. Please upload full copies when convenient.
CLIENT: Understood — I'll upload full files by end of day.
HARPER AGENT: Perfect. We'll note that in the file and proceed with carriers. Talk soon.
