# SMS Summary for Harper

## Message Type

- **Date/Time:** December 5, 2025 at 1:32 AM
- **Message Category:** System/Legal Notice

## Message Content
- **Type:** Unsubscribe notification footer
- **Content:** Standard compliance message informing recipient of ability to reply "STOP" to unsubscribe from future messages

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Content Limitations
- **No substantive business or personal information present** in this message
- Message appears to be a **system-generated footer/disclaimer** rather than actual business communication
- No details about:
  - Insurance coverage, policies, or quotes
  - Business information
  - Customer details or contact information
  - Claims or renewals
  - Action items or follow-ups

### Possible Scenarios
- This may be a **template/footer message** captured separately from full SMS thread
- Could be the **conclusion of a longer SMS conversation** where main content was sent separately
- Might be an **automated compliance message** appended to a business SMS

## Recommended Action for Harper
- **Request full SMS thread context** if available to understand the complete conversation
- Verify this message was part of an intended customer communication
- Review SMS compliance procedures to ensure all outgoing messages include proper unsubscribe language (as this one does)
