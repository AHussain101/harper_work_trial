Application Received — Next Steps

Hi Maya,

This is to confirm we have your completed application for Sunny Days Childcare. Summary of requested coverage: General Liability for a daycare operation, typical limits requested are $1M per occurrence / $2M aggregate. We will also request specific wording for childcare operations and abuse/molestation coverage as applicable.

Please confirm the estimated average daily attendance and number of staff on site. If you can reply with approximate counts (for example: ~20 children, 6 staff), that will help expedite underwriting.

Once carriers return initial indications (usually 24–72 hours), we will share preliminary quotes and any subjectivities.

Regards,
Jordan Kim
Harper Insurance
