**SUMMARY**

Harper Insurance has submitted Sunny Days Childcare's application to carriers and expects initial responses soon. Jordan Kim requests the client upload documents via secure portal (loss runs, facility inspection certificates, staff background check summaries) to expedite the process. Harper can assist with obtaining prior loss run information if needed. Client should also provide insurance requirements from contracts/leases and specify any additional coverage needs (abuse & molestation wording, sexual misconduct add-ons, higher limits).
