Insurance Application Follow-up
Hi Maya,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today — it was great learning about Sunny Days Childcare. We have submitted your application to our network of carriers and expect to see initial responses shortly.

To help us move quickly, please upload any relevant documents (loss runs if previously insured, certificate of any facility inspections, and any staff background check summaries) using the secure portal below.

Upload link: https://portal.example-insure.com/uploads/SDC-78

If you need help obtaining loss run information from a prior carrier, let us know and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Insurance requirements (COIs) for any contracts or leases
- Any additional coverage needs (abuse & molestation wording, sexual misconduct add-ons, limits higher than standard)

Best,
Jordan Kim
