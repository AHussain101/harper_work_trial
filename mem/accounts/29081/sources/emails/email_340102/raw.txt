Jordan,

We can bind Garage/Dealer Liability for Harrison Automotive pending receipt of a current dealer license and loss run history. Proposed reference: HAO-58-21. If the dealer license is provided and loss runs show no recent claims, we can issue terms.

Please have the agent upload documents to the portal.

Regards,
Holly Wright
