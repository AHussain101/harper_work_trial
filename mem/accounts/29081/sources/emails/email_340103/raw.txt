Hi Olivia,

Quick follow-up: to finalize the quote we need a copy of your renewed dealer license and a declarations page or loss-run summary from your prior insurer. If you can't find the loss runs, a short note with prior carrier name and policy years helps us get started.

You can reply to this email or upload documents here: https://portal.example-insure.com/upload.

Thanks,
Jordan Kim
