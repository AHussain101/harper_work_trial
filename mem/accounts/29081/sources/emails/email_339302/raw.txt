Insurance Application Follow-up

Hi Olivia,

Thank you for speaking with us today. We submitted your application to our carrier network and expect initial quotes shortly.

To help speed the process, please upload any available documents (dealer license, prior policy declarations, and loss runs) via our secure portal at https://portal.example-insure.com/upload.

Loss runs show prior claims history; if you had prior coverage, ask your previous carrier for loss runs for the last 3 years. If you need help obtaining these, reply and we can assist.

If available, please provide:
- Certificates of insurance (COI) or contract-specific coverage requirements
- Any additional coverage needs or gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
Jordan Kim
