Summary:
Olivia (owner) called through an intake partner seeking garage/general liability for a small used-car dealership in Mississippi. The dealer license is currently expired and needs renewal; client will provide an updated license. Prior insurance may have been with a small regional broker (client will confirm). Annual sales are roughly in the low tens of thousands (about $30k). No known recent claims. Security is an open lot with vehicle keys stored securely. Client prefers a $500 liability deductible and expects about two dealer plates. Quotes expected in 24-48 hours.
