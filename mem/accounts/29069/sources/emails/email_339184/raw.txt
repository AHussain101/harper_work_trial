Insurance Application Update

Hi Terry,

Thank you for speaking with us today — we appreciated the time. Your application has been submitted to our network of carriers and we expect initial quotes soon.

To help speed the process, please upload any supporting documents (loss runs, contracts, COIs) to our secure portal: https://portal.harperinsure.com/uploads/yg7b2

Loss runs: if available, provide up to the last 3 years of claim history. If you need assistance obtaining these, we can help reach out to your prior carrier.

If applicable, please also provide:
- Insurance requirements (COIs or contract-specific limits)
- Any additional coverage needs or gaps you'd like addressed

Best,
Jordan Kim
Harper Insurance
