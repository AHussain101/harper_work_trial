Hi Jordan,

Thanks — I received the quote and attachments. A couple quick questions:
1) Does this policy extend to government contracts and work performed under RFPs?  
2) Can you confirm the retroactive/preceding acts date options? I prefer we keep communications via email.

Appreciate the quick turnaround. 

Best,
