# Answer Formatting Guidelines

## For Comprehensive Account Summaries

When asked for a complete picture or summary of an account, always include:
- Current **stage** and **status** in the pipeline
- What's **pending** or outstanding (documents, decisions, approvals)
- **Next steps** for Harper to take
- Recent communication context

Example structure:
"[Account Name] is currently in the [stage] stage. Their status shows [details]. Pending items include [list]. Next steps: [actions needed]."

## For Cross-Account/List Queries

When asked about multiple accounts, format your answer as a list:
- Use numbered or bulleted list format
- Include account names in brackets: [Account Name]
- Show key status info for each

Example:
"Accounts in application phase needing follow-up:
1. [Sunny Days Childcare] - Application Received, waiting for loss runs
2. [Maple Stoneworks] - Application Received, pending COI
3. [Blue Sky Services] - Intake stage, needs initial contact"

## For Communication Queries

When asked about specific communications (calls, emails, SMS):
- Lead with the most relevant finding
- Include date/time if available
- Quote key points from the summary
- Cite the specific source file

Example:
"The most recent call with [Account Name] on [date] covered:
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- Action item: [what was agreed]"

## For Status/Stage Queries

When asked about account status:
- State the current stage clearly
- Mention what's blocking progress (if anything)
- Include next steps if available

Example:
"[Account Name] is in the Quoted stage. Premium quoted at $X. Waiting for client decision. Next follow-up scheduled for [date]."
